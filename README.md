# Logistics

This is the logistics page for the Spring 2018 **Stable Isotope Fractionation** class at the University of Colorado Boulder. Details on reading, homework and project assignments will be filled in throughout the semester. For details on the syllabus see [2018-Stable-Isotope-Fractionation.github.io/syllabus](https://2018-Stable-Isotope-Fractionation.github.io/syllabus).

## Resources

 - [Shared Google Drive](https://goo.gl/yYxMR1) (readings and slides)
 - [RStudio Server](moab.colorado.edu:8787) (IDE for programming exercises, assignments and projects, only accessible on campus or via CU Boulder VPN)
 - [GitHub](https://github.com/) (version control used for all assignments)

### GitHub

For this course we will be making extensive use of the document and code management and collaboration system Git and the online platform GitHub Classroom which is an extension of the popular code-sharing site GitHub. If you've never heard of GitHub, don't panic, absolutely no prior knowledge is necessary and everything will be explained in step-by-step video tutorials posted together with [class assignments](https://2018-Stable-Isotope-Fractionation.github.io/schedule/#assignments). For this course we'll be mostly working with just the core features of GitHub but as you'll see, even just the basics are quite powerful and might come in handy in other classes or your career. If you are already familiar with GitHub, you're of course welcome to keep using whichever tools you like best to work with the platform. For the purpose of keeping access simple, the class will focus on introducing web-based interactions with GitHub that don't require installing any programs on your own computer.

### Computer Access

Most assignments require access to a computer with internet connection outside of class. If you do not have a personal computer, you are encouraged to make use of the computer lab in the Department of Geological Sciences. The computer lab is open M-F from 6:30am to 6pm and available to you unless it is in active use by a computing class. Should you require after-hour access to the computer lab, please send me an email and include the last 7 digits of your BuffOne card number.

## Schedule
